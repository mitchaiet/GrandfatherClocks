# Digital Vinyl Clock Concept

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/finnhvman/pen/goBayE](https://codepen.io/finnhvman/pen/goBayE).

I had this idea a few years ago: turning a vinyl into a digital clock. The vinyl needs to be laser cut into three parts: the outer hour ring, the middle ring for tens of minutes, and the remaining part for ones of minutes. The numbers should be laser cut from the rings as well. A backlight on the left and rotational positioning of the rings form the current time in hours and minutes.

Should work on Chrome (best), Firefox and Safari.
